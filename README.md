# mask_off

This is the project we presented for Essteem's Equalithon called Justice for Black Lives. The idea was to create a platform called 'Mask Off' for people to connect and form genuine relationships with others based on their gifts, skills, talents and interests. We wanted to build a project that could be different to what is already in the market. My role in my first hackathon was to provide insights regarding UX and assess how we could improve the concept.

In this repository you will find:

- The slides of the presentation.

- The app prototype.
